## Introduction

HI! This is my **get_next_line** project at 42 school ! The aim of **get_next_line** build a function that will return the next line from file. The file descriptor of the file that we wanna read from is passed as argument to the function. 

The should be able to read from the text file and handle multiple file descriptors, reading lines of different lengths. Also the function should handle empty lines, reaching the end of a file and have in mind error handling.

## Key Concepts

### Static variables

A static variable is a variable that keeps its value throughout the entire program ****and is has a local scope. This means that its life-time is equal to the life-time of the program so its value persists throughout  various functions calls.

### **Global Variables**

A global variable is a variable that is defined outside of any function. It has a global scope which means it can be accessed and modified by any part of the program. However, its value remains throughout the execution of the program.

### Buffer

A buffer is a temporary storage space that stores data in order to balance processing speed between two systems or components. It helps ensure a steady flow of data.

### File Descriptors

A file descriptor is a number that identifies a specific open file in a computerâ€™s operating system . It describes a data resource and how it can be accessed. When a program asks to open a file the kernel grants him access.
